# [ARC9] Sticker Pack Maker++
### ♡ Made by Midawek ♡ with love for ARC9 Community ♡
[ARC9] Sticker Pack Maker++ is a cli/python tool that allows you to create stickers in bulk or invidually in to a ready to use addon.

## Features

- IT IS NOT A FORK but based off the original.

- Unattended import (Bulk support without need to invidually name and give description of every sticker)

- Supports PNG, WEBP, JPG, JPEG images

- No watermark:tm:

- `TBA` Full blown GIF Support



## Stuff you need

You may need to install `pip` by using this [link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), since the first time run needs to install a depency for the script to work


## How do I use it?!?!?!?!!?!?!
Download the release here

1. Put it in the same folder as the folder containing images.
```
folder somewhere on your pc
├── arc9stickerpackmaker++.exe
└── images
    ├── 1.png
    ├── 2.png
    └── 3.png
```
3. Follow the instructions in the command line interface
4. After you are done in the same folder as the script a new folder `arc9_yourname_stickers` should appear, put this in your addons folder in Garry's mod to test it out
5. Upload it using tools like [GMPublisher](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/gmpublisher)
